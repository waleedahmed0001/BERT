# BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language representation model introduced by Google in 2018. It has revolutionized many natural language processing (NLP) tasks by providing contextualized word embeddings.

This repository is likely focused on utilizing BERT embeddings. BERT embeddings are learned representations of words or sentences that capture their contextual meaning. These embeddings are generated by passing text through a pre-trained BERT model, which encodes the information in a way that considers the surrounding context.
